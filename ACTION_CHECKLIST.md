## üì± DEMO SCRIPT FOR TEACHER

```powershell
# Run this in your project folder
cd "d:\FAST NU\Semester - 07\MLOPs\mlops-assignment"

# Show project structure
Write-Host "=== Project Structure ===" -ForegroundColor Green

## üéñÔ∏è SUBMISSION PACKAGE

Create a folder with:
- [ ] **Source Code** (your entire project)

- [ ] **Screenshots** of Jenkins pipeline (if running)
- [ ] **SUBMISSION_REPORT.md** (already created)
- [ ] **Demo video** (record 2-3 minutes showing the pipeline)

## ‚ö° QUICK WIN - If Jenkins Won't Work

Focus on showing:
1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** - Your workflows are already working
2. ‚úÖ **Docker Build** - Show local docker build working
3. ‚úÖ **Application Running** - Show Flask app with endpoints
4. ‚úÖ **Code Quality** - Show flake8 and tests passing

**This is already 80% of what teachers want to see!**
